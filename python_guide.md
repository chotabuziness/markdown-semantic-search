# Python Programming Guide

## Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Data Structures
Python provides several built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
These data structures are fundamental to writing efficient Python code.

### Lists
Lists are ordered, mutable collections that can contain elements of different types.
You can perform operations like append, insert, and remove on lists.

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries store key-value pairs and provide fast lookup times.
They are implemented using hash tables internally.

## Functions and Modules
Functions help organize code into reusable blocks.
Modules allow you to organize related functions and classes together.
Python's import system makes it easy to reuse code across projects.
